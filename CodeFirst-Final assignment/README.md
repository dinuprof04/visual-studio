# C# Development Projects

This repository showcases various projects I've built using **C#** and **.NET Framework** through coursework, independent study, and hands-on debugging. These exercises strengthened my skills in object-oriented programming, MVC patterns, data management, and Entity Framework integration.

## Project Overview

- Car Insurance Quote System (ASP.NET MVC)
- Student Management Database (Entity Framework Code-First)
- Package Shipping Calculator (Console App)
- Mathematical and Logical Operations
- Loop and Iteration Exercises
- Array and List Processing
- String Manipulation and Error Handling

## Car Insurance Quote System

An **ASP.NET MVC web application** simulating a car insurance quoting platform. Users enter policy information, and the system computes quotes based on predefined business rules.

**Core Features:**
- MVC design pattern implementation
- Input validation and form processing
- Quote calculation algorithms
- Admin dashboard displaying all quotes

**Tech Stack:** C#, ASP.NET MVC, Razor syntax, .NET Framework

---

## Student Database (EF Code-First)

A **console-based application** utilizing **Entity Framework Code-First** to auto-generate a database schema from C# model classes and insert student records.

**Core Features:**
- Automatic database creation from code
- DbContext and DbSet implementation
- Schema generation and migrations
- Programmatic data entry

**Tech Stack:** C#, .NET Framework, Entity Framework 6, SQL Server/LocalDB

---

## Package Shipping Calculator

**Console application** for generating shipping quotes based on package dimensions and weight, featuring input validation and tiered pricing logic.

**Core Features:**
- Interactive user input processing
- Conditional business rules
- Mathematical computations
- Formatted console output

**Tech Stack:** C#, .NET Framework

## Mathematical & Logical Exercises

Console programs illustrating:
- Numeric computations
- Boolean operations
- Conditional branching (`if/else` statements)

These solidify fundamental programming principles.

---

## Control Flow & Loops

Console demos covering:
- `for` loop patterns
- `while` and `do-while` constructs

Focused on iteration strategies and flow control.

---

## Collections & Data Structures

Console applications handling:
- Single-dimension arrays
- Dynamic lists
- Index-based access
- Bounds checking and exceptions

Emphasizes data organization and traversal.

---

## Text Processing & Robustness

Projects featuring:
- String operations and parsing
- Input sanitization
- Exception handling (`try/catch`)
- User-friendly error recovery

---

## Acquired Competencies

- C# syntax and OOP principles
- ASP.NET MVC application lifecycle
- Entity Framework 6 Code-First workflows
- Database connectivity (SQL Server/LocalDB)
- Console and web app development
- Systematic debugging techniques
- GitHub repository management and README authoring
